I am learning CSS on Free Code Camp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/, leave notes here for the future review.

# 1 Term explaination

1. The **rem** unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.

2. Use `<span>` to align the characters in one line, for example:
```html
<h1>Calories <span class="float right">230</span></h1>
```

3. The `overflow` property modifies when frame elements have overlap with contents, see here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow.
