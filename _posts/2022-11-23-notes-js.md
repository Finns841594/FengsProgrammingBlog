# 0 Personal notes for JavaScript

# 1 Variables:

Here are my recommendations:

1. Use `const` when you can - use `let` if you have to
2. Never use `var` unless someone is twisting your arm.
3. Indicated no value using `null` - never using `undefined`.

# 2 String Interpolation:

Use `${}` in string.

`console.log("Counter is now '${variable}'");`

# 3 Copy an arry

`...`can be used when copying, it is the spread operator.

```js
const names = ['Marcus','Eliza','Obaid'];
assert.equal(names.length, 3);
// Copy
const newNames = [...names, 'Arvid'];
```
