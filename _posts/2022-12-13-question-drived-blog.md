# Question-drived article

## 1. Why writting this post?

I have written several posts here for recording my process of learning programming and others. I also gained some experience in writing, in English specificly. And I got an idea for the furture writing, to help with building a better structure of articles.

## 2. What is question-drived?

I believe this term or concept exits already. My definetion for it, is a article is structured by questions and answered for those questions.

## 3. Why it helped with blogging?

I think my blog posts help me to record my process of learning, but not necessarily in a way of telling story. It will be better in a way of showing what problems have I meet and how I solved them.
